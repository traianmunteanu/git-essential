As my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, entered the shop, his deep-seated, keen eyes immediately perceived that a man had hanged himself from a hook in the ceiling. Following after him, I had the fact pointed out to me.

"It is eighteen pages long, more than all the other contributions together."

"Quite so! And what is the subject of the article?"

It had not occurred to me to consider that matter before. Now I looked.

"The article is called: 'Do Balrogs Have Wings, and Do They Flap?', but I really do not understand..." I fell silent as an icy emotion of terror permeated every inch of my body. I looked up at the pathetic, silent frame hanging from the ceiling. "He went out this morning, happy in his newly blackened boots. Coming into this shop, he meant to while away the time waiting for the proprietor by doing some reading, and then..."

"This case is of course lucid, but it does have some interesting features," remarked Holmes.

"How do you mean?"

"Watson, I really would be at a loss what to do without you! Your predictability is like the Rock of Gibraltar. Now, you do see that this man's shoes have been newly blackened?"

"Yes."

"Furthermore, I notice that he has stood an excellent, fastidiously rolled umbrella against the counter, as if waiting for the proprietor to turn up."

"Yes. Where is the proprietor, by the way?"

"Really, Watson, I should have thought even you realized that the proprietor's whereabouts has no bearing on to the case."

I apologized.
